# My first GitHub Page!
GitHub Pages allows you to create sites from GitHub repositories.
Easily.
So here's how to make one:
  **Step 1: Create a GitHub account if you haven't already done that [here.](https://github.com/signup)  
  Step 2: Create a GitHub repository on your profile -> Green button saying "New" with a book icon.  
  Step 3: Inside the repository, create HTML files. If you wanna learn HTML, you can do so [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQdaUv95mR8)  
  Step 4: After you've added the HTML files, turn on GitHub Pages.  
  Step 5: Go to the site, shown when you enable GitHub Pages. Done!  
  You've successfully made a GitHub Page!**
